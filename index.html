                <p class="c-card__text">5G stands for the fifth generation of the next wireless mobile standard.

                <p class="c-card__text">As a subscriber becomes more aware of the mobile phone technology, he/she will seek for an appropriate package all together, including all the advanced features of a cellular phone can have. Hence, the search for new technology is always the main intention of the prime cell phone giants to out innovate their competitors. In addition, the main purpose of the fifth generation wireless networks (5G Wireless networks) is planned to design the best wireless world that is free from limitations and hindrance of the previous generations. At the moment, it’s not yet clear which technologies will do the most for 5G in the long run, but a few early favorites have emerged. The front-runners include millimeter waves, small cells, massive MIMO, full duplex, and beamforming. To understand how 5G will differ from today’s 4G networks, it’s helpful to walk through these five technologies and consider what each will mean for wireless users.</p>

                <p class="c-card__text">CPS include traditional embedded and control systems, and these will be transformed by new approaches from IoT. However, the challenge for IoT and CPS remains security and risk management. As less rigorously controlled systems are linked then risk becomes distributed and the provenance of software components becomes difficult to trace. This gives rise to questions around risk management and liability for breaches or damages. As demonstrated in the 2014 Target hack, via their heating, ventilation and air conditioning provider's system, third party systems are now attack vectors. Further, regulators have not yet addressed this issue of distributed or daisy-chained risk arising from connected systems. Attacks on connected systems from nation-state actors and non-state actors are also an increasing threat: "According to Crowdstrike researchers, targeted intrusions will continue to proliferate and nation-states will use espionage to collect information from any organization with valuable data that will serve the country's national interests.The big challenges that are raised by IoT and CPS center on risk, security, geopolitics, trust, and privacy.</p>

When wireless sensor networks are deployed in a hostile terrain, security becomes extremely important, as they are prone to different types of malicious attacks. Due to the inherent resource limitations of sensor nodes, existing network security methods, including those developed for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks, are not well suitable for wireless sensor networks. As a crucial issue security in wireless sensor networks has attracted a lot of attention in the recent year. Researchers are working on a thorough analysis of the major security issue and presented the ongoing aspect of further development to designers in their struggle to implement the most cost effective and appropriate method of securing their network.</p>

The basic clock frequency signal (in hertz) that drives the clock was generated using a clock voltage source of the simulator for frequency division of the desired clock pulse. The digital clock circuit was implemented and simulated using Proteus software version 8.6 on personal computer (PC).</p></a>

Mains requirements were: * No separate supply for the remote circuit * Main and remote units connected by a thin two-wire cable * Simple LED display for the main unit * Battery operation to avoid problems related to mains supply and water proximity * As the circuit was battery operated a low current consumption was obviously welcomed.</p></a>
